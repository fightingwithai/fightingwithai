Talk to your AI instead of typing. It's faster.

## The Quiet Revolution

At startups, developers are buying dedicated microphones for their desks. Blue Yetis. Shure MV7s. Not for podcasting—for coding.

Voice input is 3x faster than typing for most people. When you're pair programming with an AI all day, that adds up.

## Skip the SaaS

Most transcription services are just wrapping OpenAI's Whisper with a nice UI. Whisper is open source. The model is free.

[Handy](https://handy.computer/) is a free, open-source speech-to-text app. It's a Rust wrapper around Whisper C++ and the Parakeet models. Everything runs locally.

- **Free** — no subscription
- **Private** — voice never leaves your machine
- **Fast** — GPU-accelerated, near-instant

Push a shortcut, talk, release. Text appears wherever your cursor is.

## Getting Started

1. Get a decent microphone. Laptop mics work, dedicated mics are clearer.
2. Install [Handy](https://handy.computer/)
3. Set a push-to-talk shortcut
4. Practice. Feels weird at first. Give it a week.
