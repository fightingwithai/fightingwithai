title: Meta Prompts
---

A meta prompt is a prompt that generates or refines other prompts. Instead of writing the final prompt yourself, you ask the model to produce it.

```
Given a task description, output a detailed system prompt
that would help an AI assistant complete that task effectively.
Include constraints, format requirements, and edge cases.
```

This shifts effort from crafting individual prompts to designing templates that produce good prompts across many tasks.
