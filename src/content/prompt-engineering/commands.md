title: Slash Commands

Slash commands let you trigger a block of text with a few keystrokes. If you find yourself repeatedly correcting the same mistake or giving the same instruction, a slash command turns that into a shortcut.

Type `/fix-imports` and the model receives your full instructions on import conventions. A few characters in, a wall of context out.

Some tools call these "prompts" or "saved prompts."
