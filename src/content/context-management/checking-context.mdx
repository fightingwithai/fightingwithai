Some tools let you see what's actually in the context window. Checking context regularly—not just when things go wrong—helps you stay aware of what the model is working with.

## What You See

The context window contains everything the model processes when generating a response:

- The system prompt (often hidden by default)
- Conversation history
- Tool outputs and file contents
- Summaries from prior compactions

When the model produces unexpected output, inspecting context often reveals why—a stale summary, a hallucinated file path that was never corrected, or instructions that contradicted each other.

But checking context proactively is even more valuable. Before starting a complex task, a quick check confirms you have the right setup. Between tasks, it shows whether residual context from previous work might interfere.

## Example

<div>
  <Image src={contextUsageExample} alt="Claude Code /context command showing context usage breakdown" />
</div>

In Claude Code, the `/context` command shows exactly what's consuming context:

- **System prompt**: Base instructions
- **System tools**: Built-in tool definitions
- **MCP tools**: External tool definitions
- **Memory files**: CLAUDE.md and other loaded files
- **Messages**: The actual conversation
- **Free space**: Room for more conversation
- **Autocompact buffer**: Reserved space for automatic compaction

In this example, after a mistake that generated noise, the context was 57% full. The breakdown revealed accumulated message tokens from failed attempts—a signal that [clearing](/context-management/clear) would produce better results than continuing.

## Why It Matters

The model responds to what's in context, not what you intended to put there. Checking context closes the gap between "what I think the model sees" and "what the model actually sees."

This is particularly useful before [clearing](/context-management/clear) or [compacting](/context-management/compact)—you can verify whether context is salvageable or too polluted to work with.
