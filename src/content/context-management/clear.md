Clears the entire conversation and starts from scratch. Everything in the context window is gone—summaries, code references, prior decisions, all of it.

Useful when context gets too polluted to salvage—[[spiraling]] loops, [[context-collapse|context collapse]], or accumulated noise from failed attempts.

Also useful proactively between discrete tasks. Write an article, clear, write another. Prevents [[context-contamination|context contamination]] where unrelated work bleeds together.

[[rewinding|Rewinding]] is less drastic when only recent context went wrong.
