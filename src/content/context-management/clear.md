title: Clear / New
dependsOn: checking-context
---

Clears the entire conversation and starts from scratch. Everything in the context window is gone—summaries, code references, prior decisions, all of it.

Useful when context gets too polluted to salvage—[spiraling](/failure-modes/spiraling) loops, [context collapse](/failure-modes/context-collapse), or accumulated noise from failed attempts.

Also useful proactively between discrete tasks. Write an article, clear, write another. Prevents [context contamination](/failure-modes/context-contamination) where unrelated work bleeds together.

[Rewinding](/context-management/rewinding) is less drastic when only recent context went wrong.
