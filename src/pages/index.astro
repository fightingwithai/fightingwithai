    <p class="lead">AI can generate code faster than any human.</p>
    <p class="lead">It can also confidently generate the wrong code — and keep insisting it's right.</p>
    <p class="lead">The industry is reacting instead of understanding: hype on one side, rejection on the other.</p>
    <p class="lead">This site is about neither.</p>
    <p class="lead">AI can replace reading, thinking, or typing — or some combination. This guide doesn't tell you which to choose. It provides patterns to discuss these tradeoffs intentionally.</p>
    <p class="lead">It's a pattern catalog for working with AI without surrendering control. Every tool calls these concepts something different — prompts, commands, skills, rules. The patterns underneath are the same.</p>

    <p class="lead">This guide does not argue that AI "doesn't work," nor that it should be avoided. It documents where it works, where it breaks, and what to do about it.</p>
