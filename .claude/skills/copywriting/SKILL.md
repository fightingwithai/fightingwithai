# Copywriting Skill

When writing or editing content for this book, follow these guidelines.

## Voice

From CLAUDE.md:
- **ELI5**: Simple, clear language
- **Short and direct**: No fluff
- **Concrete over abstract**: Show the situation, name the pattern, explain the move

## Section Headers

Use these standard headers in failure modes and patterns:

| Use | Avoid |
|-----|-------|
| Theory | Why This Happens |
| Symptoms | Signs / Indicators |
| Mitigation | How to Fix / Solution |

## Succinctness

- Cut filler words: "basically", "essentially", "in order to", "actually"
- Prefer short sentences
- One idea per bullet point
- If you can say it in fewer words, do

## Examples

Bad:
> This essentially happens because the AI is basically trying to optimize for context efficiency, which actually causes it to miss important information.

Good:
> The AI optimizes for context efficiency and misses important information.
